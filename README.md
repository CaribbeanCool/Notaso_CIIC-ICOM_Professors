# Notaso_CIIC-ICOM_Professors
A Python web-scraper that scrapes from the website [Notaso](https://notaso.com/universities/urpm/) and:
1. Finds all professors from the CSE and ECE Department, and
2. Finds the professor's rating, and student's comments.


## How to Run:
- You need BeautifulSoup4 and Requests in your laptop/PC to run this code. The command to install is below:
```
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install requests
```
- Open up terminal, locate folder destination and type:
```
python scraper.py
```
